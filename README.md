# Replication Package for "Evaluating Software Plagiarism Detection in the Age of AI"

This is the replication package for the paper titled "Evaluating Software Plagiarism Detection in the Age of AI".
The defence mechanisms were also integrated into the source code plagiarism detection system [JPlag](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag/) to ensure they are widely accessible.
The replication package is structured as follows.

- the `datasets` folder contains the artifacts of the evaluation datasets.
- the `raw-results` folder contains the measured results of our evaluation.
- the `evaluation-scripts` folder contains the code for plotting and statistical tests.
- the `implementation` folder contains the JPlag-based implementation.
